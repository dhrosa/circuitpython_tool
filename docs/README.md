# circuitpython-tool

`circuitpython-tool` is a command-line utility for conveniently addressing and
uploading code to CircuitPython devices in a consistent way. Especially when
multiple devices are connected to the same computer.

This tool is designed for a workflow where instead of editing files directly on
the CircuitPython device, you edit files on your computer and sync the code over
to the device.
